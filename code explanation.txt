Then, the attendance status of the selected student in self.students[selected_row][6] is updated with the new value.

#This part of the method populates the table widget with the student information from the self.students list. It iterates over each student using enumerate(self.students), which provides both the index (row) and the student record (student).
For each student, a QTableWidgetItem is created for each piece of information (name, father's name, roll number, semester, section, fees paid, and attendance status). These items are then set in the respective cells of the table widget using self.table_widget.setItem(row, column, item). The row parameter determines the row index, while the column parameter is set to the appropriate value for each item.
This process repeats for each student, populating the entire table widget with the student records.
#Overall, update_table() ensures that the table widget reflects the current state of the student records in the self.students list.
